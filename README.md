Problem Statement
We are to answer questions that involve the use of meteorology instruments that measure wind speed and rain rate. The questions are as follows.

4) For each site, plot wind speed (in m/w) and rain rate (in mm/hr). Find these time windows: when it is windy and rainy, when it is rainy but not windy, when it is windy but not rainy, when it is not windy not rainy. Show each time period on your plot (for example, use different colors and have a legend to show which region each color represents)

5) Plot the cross-correlation function between wind speed at both sites? What is the highest correlation? What is the time lag?

6) Plot the cross-correlation function between rain rate at both sites? What is the highest correlation? What is the time lag? 

7) Is there any relationship between the time lag of wind speed and rain rate?

8) In another plot, calculate and plot the monthly average of the wind speed and rain rate for each site
What pattern do you see? Explain.
Which month had the highest rain rate? Which month had the lowest rain rate? 
Which month had the highest wind speed? Which month had the lowest wind speed?
